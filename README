This is a small project to control VLC Media player using an old TV remote control. 

An Arduino is used to interface with a IR Diode and return hex codes to the system using a serial port. 
A Python script is used to monitor the serial interface and based on the input will send commands to VLC using HTTP interface. 


More details coming soon.
